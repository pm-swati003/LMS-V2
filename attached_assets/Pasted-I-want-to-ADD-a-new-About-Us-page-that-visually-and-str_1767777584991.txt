I want to ADD a new “About Us” page that visually and structurally matches the provided design image.

🔒 STRICT RULES (Must Follow Exactly)

DO NOT modify any existing pages, navbar UI, footer, layout, or shared components.

DO NOT change index.css, App.jsx, main.jsx, Tailwind config, or global styles.

Only ADD new files if required (page + small reusable components).

Reuse existing Tailwind colors, spacing, typography, and button styles.

Navbar and footer must remain exactly the same.

🔗 Navigation & Routing

The existing About link in the navbar should navigate to /about

Use the existing routing setup (React Router)

SPA navigation only (no page reload)

Do not refactor existing routes

📄 Page Structure (Match Design Closely)
1️⃣ Hero / Banner Section

Full-width top banner

Dark purple gradient background

Centered page title: About Us

Breadcrumb below title: Home / About Us

Same height, spacing, and typography as shown in the image

Subtitle: Public university in Belagavi, Karnataka

Two-column layout:

🎨 UI & UX Guidelines

Clean academic / university-style design

Consistent spacing, hierarchy, and alignment

📁 File & Code Expectations

Create AboutPage.jsx (or similar)

Export as default

Use static placeholder images and text

Code should be clean, modular, and production-ready
