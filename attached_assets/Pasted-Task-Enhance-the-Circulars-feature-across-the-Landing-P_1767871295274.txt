Task: Enhance the Circulars feature across the Landing Page and create a dedicated Circulars page with consistent design.

1️⃣ Update Landing Page – Circulars Section

In the existing Circulars section on the Landing Page:

Add a primary button labeled “View All Circulars”.

Position the button below the two circular cards or aligned to the section footer.

Button styling should match existing primary buttons (color, radius, hover state).

On click:

Navigate to the Circulars page using client-side routing (React Router / Wouter, depending on setup).

Route path: /circulars.

2️⃣ Create a New Circulars Page

Create a new page named Circulars.

Design must follow the same layout and styling as the Privacy Policy page, including:

Hero/Header section with:

Page title: Circulars

Breadcrumb: Home > Circulars

Same background gradient, spacing, typography, and alignment.

Below the header, replace policy text content with two cards layout.

3️⃣ Circulars Page – Content Structure
Layout

Display two large cards side-by-side (responsive → stack on mobile):

Exam Circulars

Admissions Circulars

Each Card Should:

Have a clear title (Exam Circulars / Admissions Circulars).

Contain a scrollable list of circular items.

Display all circulars, including:

Latest

Older circulars (no pagination for now).

Each circular item should include:

Circular title

Date

“NEW” badge for recent items

Clickable row (optional: future PDF/detail navigation)

4️⃣ UI & UX Guidelines

Use card design identical to Landing Page Circular cards:

Rounded corners

Soft shadow

Clean spacing

Maintain:

Same font family

Same color tokens

Same badge styles

Ensure accessibility:

Proper contrast

Keyboard-friendly scrolling

Make lists vertically scrollable if content exceeds height.

5️⃣ Routing & Navigation

Ensure:

Landing Page “View All Circulars” button routes correctly to /circulars.

Circulars page is accessible via URL and navigation flow.

Keep routing consistent with existing Privacy Policy / Terms pages.

6️⃣ Scope Notes

No backend or API required (static/mock data is fine).

Focus on UI consistency, layout, and navigation.

Follow existing project structure and component patterns.
