You are working on an existing VTU Online React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project.

OBJECTIVE:
Add a new “Cookie Policy” page and connect it to the existing footer link labeled “Cookie Policy”.

STRICT RULES:
1. DO NOT modify any existing files unless absolutely required for routing.
2. DO NOT change Navbar, Footer UI structure, colors, spacing, or existing links.
3. DO NOT remove or rename any existing routes.
4. Keep styling consistent with the existing design system.
5. Use Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles, no new CSS files).
6. The page must be fully responsive.

------------------------------------
ROUTING REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------
• Create a new route:
  /cookie-policy

• Ensure the existing footer link “Cookie Policy” navigates to:
  /cookie-policy

• If routing is centralized (Router.jsx / routes config), only ADD the route — do not refactor.

------------------------------------
PAGE STRUCTURE (MATCH EXACTLY)
------------------------------------

1️⃣ HERO SECTION
• Full-width hero banner
• Dark blue / navy gradient background
• Center-aligned content
• Large title: "Cookie Policy"
• Breadcrumb text below title:
  Home > Cookie Policy

• Height similar to other policy pages (FAQ / Support)

------------------------------------

2️⃣ CONTENT SECTION (CENTERED, READABLE WIDTH)

Include the following sections with proper spacing and typography:

SECTION 1:
Title: "1. What Are Cookies?"
